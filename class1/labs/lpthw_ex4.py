"""Extra Credit

When I wrote this program the first time I had a mistake,
and python told me about it like this:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "ex4.py", line 8, in <module>
    average_passengers_per_car = car_pool_capacity / passenger
NameError: name 'car_pool_capacity' is not defined

Explain this error in your own words. Make sure you use line numbers and
explain why.

car_pool_capacity != carpool_capacity
they are written differently in line 7 and 14
