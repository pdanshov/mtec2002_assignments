loops_cubes
=====

Use a for loop that will iterate over a list and create a new list with the cubes of every value in the first list.  Use range to create the initial list.  Use whatever method you want to create the new list.  Print out the new list.

Example Output:
if range(10) were used, the output would be:
[0, 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729]
